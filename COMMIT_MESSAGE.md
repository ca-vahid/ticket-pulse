# Initial Commit: Ticket Pulse Dashboard with Weekly View

Comprehensive IT helpdesk dashboard for FreshService ticket management with real-time updates and weekly analytics.

## Major Features

### Weekly View Implementation
- âœ… Daily/Weekly view toggle with week-by-week navigation (Monday-Sunday)
- âœ… Week range display with previous/next navigation
- âœ… "This Week" quick jump button
- âœ… Monthly view placeholder (under construction)

### Centralized Statistics Engine
- âœ… Created `backend/src/services/statsCalculator.js` as single source of truth
- âœ… Refactored all endpoints to use centralized calculations
- âœ… Eliminated ~230 lines of duplicate code across endpoints
- âœ… Ensures data consistency between dashboard and detail views

### Accurate Date Tracking
- âœ… Fixed ticket assignment tracking to use `firstAssignedAt` instead of `createdAt`
- âœ… Fixed closed tickets calculation to use `closedAt`/`resolvedAt` dates
- âœ… Ensures accurate weekly aggregations

### Daily Breakdown Visualization
- âœ… Color-coded mini-calendars showing daily ticket distribution (Mon-Sun)
- âœ… Implemented in both compact and grid card layouts
- âœ… Normalized color gradients based on relative ticket volumes:
  - White = 0 tickets
  - Light green = low activity (1-33%)
  - Medium green = moderate activity (34-66%)
  - Dark green = high activity (67-100%)
- âœ… Hover tooltips showing detailed breakdown (self/assigned/closed)

### Navigation & State Management
- âœ… Fixed back button to preserve view mode (daily/weekly)
- âœ… Browser back/forward maintains selectedWeek state
- âœ… Proper state passing between Dashboard and TechnicianDetail pages
- âœ… Weekly stats refresh correctly when navigating between weeks

### UI/UX Improvements
- âœ… Made weekly mini-calendar non-clickable to prevent confusion
- âœ… Added construction icon to Monthly button for clarity
- âœ… Removed trailing whitespace from view toggle buttons
- âœ… Consistent visual design across compact and grid views
