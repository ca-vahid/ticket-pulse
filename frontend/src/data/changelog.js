    entries: [
      { type: 'new', text: 'Redesigned dashboard stats bar — two-zone flex layout replaces the old 3-column grid; date navigation anchored on the left, all stats + self-pick progress + view toggle on the right; cleaner separation between controls and data' },
      { type: 'new', text: 'View toggle (Daily / Weekly / Monthly) moved to far right of the stats bar — treated as a mode selector alongside the data, not mixed into the navigation zone; consistent with standard UI patterns' },
      { type: 'new', text: 'Compact view toggle moved into the Technicians section — Cards / Compact segmented control now lives above the tech list where it contextually belongs, removed from the top header' },
      { type: 'new', text: 'Timeline Explorer redesigned to match the Dashboard header — white top bar (Back, title, tech count, picked/not-picked totals, refresh) + gradient nav bar (date nav on left, Day by Day/Combined + Daily/Weekly/Monthly on right)' },
      { type: 'new', text: 'Scoped ticket loading (getAllActiveScoped) — backend now fetches only tickets relevant to the requested date range plus open/pending and CSAT records, instead of loading every ticket for every technician on every request' },
      { type: 'new', text: 'Speculative cache warmup on page load — DashboardContext prefetches current week, today, and weekly stats immediately on mount using a _speculative flag that suppresses 401 auth redirects, so data is ready before the first render' },
      { type: 'new', text: 'Shared Prisma singleton (prisma.js) — all services and routes now share one PrismaClient instance instead of creating one per module, eliminating connection pool exhaustion under load' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Dashboard white header is now sticky (z-40) — stays visible at the top while scrolling through the technician list' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Gradient stats bar is now sticky (z-30, top-[52px]) — docks directly below the sticky white header; keeps date context, stats, and view controls visible when scrolling' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Default view on first load changed from Daily to Weekly — weekly overview gives a better immediate picture of team workload for coordinators arriving each morning' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Stats and avoidance analysis run in parallel (Promise.all) — daily and weekly dashboard endpoints no longer wait for avoidance analysis to finish before returning stats; reduces response latency' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Background sync status polling deferred until primary data arrives — prevents unnecessary /sync/status requests during the cold load phase, reducing startup network chatter' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Adjacent-period prefetch gated on primaryDataReady — usePrefetch no longer fires before the active view has rendered, preventing redundant fetches that compete with the primary request' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Sync buttons simplified — removed dropdown wrapper; Sync All and Sync Week are now plain paired icon buttons with cleaner disabled state (opacity-40 instead of opacity-50)' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Speculative 401 errors silenced — requests fired during the auth-check window carry a _speculative flag; if they get a 401, the auth:unauthorized event is suppressed so the login redirect is not triggered incorrectly' },
      { type: 'fixed', text: 'Multiple PrismaClient instances created on each request — avoidanceAnalysisService, technicianRepository, and weekly/monthly route handlers each instantiated their own PrismaClient; now all share the singleton, fixing potential connection limit errors on Azure' },
      { type: 'fixed', text: 'Weekly/monthly dashboard routes manually constructing and disconnecting PrismaClient inline — removed all ad-hoc instantiation and $disconnect() calls; shared client manages its own lifecycle' },
      { type: 'database', text: 'New index: tickets_first_assigned_at_idx on first_assigned_at — required by the scoped ticket query (OR condition on firstAssignedAt range). Migration file included (20260227000000_add_first_assigned_at_index). Run `prisma migrate deploy` on production before deploying this version.' },

      { type: 'new', text: 'Monthly view on technician detail page — Daily/Weekly/Monthly toggle in header, with month picker, calendar-grid daily breakdown (7-column Mon–Sun), monthly summary stats, averages, assigners, and CSAT; works across Overview, Tickets, Coverage, and Timeline' },
      { type: 'new', text: 'Monthly coverage analysis — new backend endpoint and service (computeTechnicianAvoidanceMonthlyDetail) returns all weekday coverage windows for the full month in a single query; Coverage tab shows a 5-column multi-row weekday grid for monthly breakdown' },
      { type: 'new', text: 'Timeline Explorer — standalone page (/timeline) with multi-technician selection, daily/weekly/monthly period controls, Day by Day / Combined view toggles, full filter bar (exclude + include), and per-agent color-coded ticket rows' },
      { type: 'new', text: 'Multi-technician timeline — select 1 or more techs from a sidebar panel; each tech gets a distinct accent color; picked tickets show which agent picked them; markers show per-agent online/offline times sorted chronologically' },
      { type: 'new', text: 'Timeline Explorer sidebar — collapsible tech selector with smooth animation; search, select all/none, per-tech picked/not-picked stats inline; selected techs sort to top alphabetically; collapsed mode shows avatars with stats' },

      { type: 'new', text: 'Batch timeline API endpoint — GET /api/dashboard/timeline accepts multiple techIds and a period (date/weekStart/month); runs avoidance analysis in parallel for all selected techs; 30-second read cache' },
      { type: 'new', text: 'Timeline button on main Dashboard header — blue outlined button with Layers icon navigates directly to /timeline' },
      { type: 'new', text: 'Full-date ticket timestamps in multi-day views — ticket rows show "1-16 Fri. 3:03 AM" format in weekly/monthly instead of ambiguous "Fri 3:03 AM"' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Timeline markers are compact — "REZA ONLINE — 08:00 VANCOUVER" shortened to "Reza on · 8am Van"; city names abbreviated (Vancouver→Van, Toronto→Tor, etc.); marker colors (green/blue/red) carry the meaning' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Timeline markers sorted by time — when no tickets trigger markers (empty days), remaining agent on/HQ on/agent off markers now sort chronologically instead of code-insertion order' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Header toggle layout stabilized — Daily/Weekly/Monthly buttons, date picker, Next button, and Today/This Week/This Month button all use fixed-width slots and invisible placeholders instead of conditional rendering, eliminating layout shifts when switching views' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Coverage filter bar moved to full width — filter bar now spans above both Picked and Not Picked columns so it is clearly a shared filter, not just for the right column' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Coverage Timeline button relocated — moved from the Picked column header to a tall button alongside the summary cards for better visibility' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'MergedTimelineModal fully refactored — ~490 lines reduced to ~120 by extracting all rendering and logic into shared timeline/* modules (TimelineCore, TimelineTicketRow, TimelineSeparators, timelineUtils); identical visual behavior' },
      { type: 'improved', text: 'Loading overlay on Timeline Explorer — same fancy multi-ring spinner with backdrop blur as the main Dashboard, shown during initial tech list load and all data fetches' },
      { type: 'fixed', text: 'Monthly coverage timeline cut off at 14 days — getWeekdaysInRange had a hardcoded loop limit of 14 iterations; now dynamically computed from the actual date range to cover any month' },
      { type: 'fixed', text: 'Per-tech picked count mismatch — stats used _techFirstName string matching which missed extended tickets; fixed to use assignedTechId for accurate counting' },
