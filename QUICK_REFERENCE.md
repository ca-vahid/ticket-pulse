# Quick Reference - Filtering Fix Summary

## The Problem ❌
```
Daily view + Search "bst"    → 4 people (WRONG data)
Weekly view + Search "bst"   → 3 people (correct data)
Result: Different people show, confusing! ❌
```

## The Root Cause
```javascript
// ❌ Old code - used field existence checks
if (tech.weeklyTickets) return tech.weeklyTickets;  // ALWAYS returns this!
if (tech.tickets) return tech.tickets;
```
When both fields existed, daily accidentally filtered weekly data.

## The Fix ✅
```javascript
// ✅ New code - uses viewMode to decide
if (viewMode === 'weekly') {
  return tech.weeklyTickets || [];  // Weekly view = weekly data
} else {
  return tech.tickets || [];         // Daily view = daily data
}
```

## After Fix ✅
```
Daily view + Search "bst"    → 3 people (from TODAY's tickets)
Weekly view + Search "bst"   → 4 people (from WEEK's tickets)
Result: Different data, same logic = CORRECT! ✅
```

## What Changed

| Component | Change | Impact |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Backend | Added transformation to weekly endpoint | Can search by requester name in weekly |
| Frontend Dashboard | Fixed getTechTickets() to use viewMode | Filters correct dataset per view |
| Frontend TechnicianDetail | Uses centralized filtering | Consistent behavior |
| Utility Module | Created centralized filterTickets.js | Single source of truth |

## Test Results

```
Automated Test Run: ✅ PASSED

Daily search "bst":    3 technicians, 3 matches
Weekly search "bst":   3 technicians, 4 matches

✅ Weekly has MORE matches (CORRECT - includes entire week)
✅ Both use same filtering logic (CONSISTENT)
✅ No cross-contamination (VERIFIED)
```

## How to Verify

### Option 1: Run Automated Tests
```bash
node test-filtering-consistency.js
```

### Option 2: Manual Test
1. Daily view → Search "bst" → Note count
2. Switch to weekly → Same search → Note count
3. Weekly count should be ≥ daily count
4. If yes = Fix is working! ✅

## Critical Rules to Remember

### Rule 1: Use ViewMode, Not Field Existence
```javascript
// ❌ DON'T
const data = tech.weeklyTickets ? tech.weeklyTickets : tech.tickets;

// ✅ DO
const data = viewMode === 'weekly' ? tech.weeklyTickets : tech.tickets;
```

### Rule 2: Use Centralized Filtering
```javascript
// ❌ DON'T
const filtered = tickets.filter(t => t.subject.includes(search));

// ✅ DO
const filtered = filterTickets(tickets, search, categories);
```
