# Centralized Filtering Implementation - Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Centralized Filtering Module
**File:** `frontend/src/utils/ticketFilter.js`

This new utility module contains all ticket filtering logic:
- `filterTickets()` - Core filtering function
- `filterTechnicianTickets()` - Filter technician's tickets with stats
- `getAvailableCategories()` - Extract categories from tickets
- `calculateFilteredStats()` - Calculate stats from filtered tickets
- `calculateResultsCount()` - Count total results

### 2. Refactored Dashboard.jsx
**Changes:**
- Removed inline `filterTicketsBySearchAndCategory()` function
- Added import: `import { filterTickets, getAvailableCategories } from '../utils/ticketFilter'`
- Changed all calls from `filterTicketsBySearchAndCategory()` to `filterTickets()`
- Both daily and weekly views now use the same filtering logic

### 3. Refactored TechnicianDetailNew.jsx
**Changes:**
- Added import of centralized utilities
- Removed inline `filterTickets()` function
- Replaced with call to `getAvailableCategories()`
- Updated `displayedTickets` filtering to use centralized `filterTickets()`

### 4. Backend Transformation Fix (Already Done)
**File:** `backend/src/routes/dashboard.routes.js`
- Fixed weekly endpoint to transform tickets: `.map(transformTicket)`
- Ensures `requesterName` is available for search

### 5. Documentation
**Files Created:**
- `FILTERING_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete architecture guide
- `CENTRALIZED_FILTERING_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Why This Fixes the Issue

### Before (Broken)
```
Daily View: filterTicketsBySearchAndCategory() [Local function]
Weekly View: filterTicketsBySearchAndCategory() [Local function]
TechnicianDetail: filterTickets() [Different local function]

→ Different implementations
→ Inconsistent results
→ Hard to maintain
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Daily View: filterTickets() [Central utility]
Weekly View: filterTickets() [Central utility]
TechnicianDetail: filterTickets() [Central utility]

→ Same implementation everywhere
→ Consistent behavior
→ Single source of truth
```

## Key Points About "Different Results"

### Daily vs Weekly View Results Differ on Purpose
This is NOT a bug. It's correct behavior:

**Daily View (Search "bst"):**
- Dataset: `tickets` (open tickets from TODAY only)
- Example result: 3 tickets

**Weekly View (Search "bst"):**
- Dataset: `weeklyTickets` (ALL tickets assigned THIS WEEK)
- Example result: 4 tickets (includes tickets from other days that week)

**Same Filtering Logic, Different Data = Correct**

### What Consistency Means
✅ **Consistent:** Both views search the same fields the same way
- Both search: subject, ID, requester name, category
- Both use case-insensitive matching
- Both apply category filter with AND logic
- **CRITICAL:** Both use the SAME filterTickets() function from centralized utility

❌ **Inconsistent:** Results would be wrong if:
- Daily search logic != Weekly search logic
- Same search term gives different field matching in different views
- Category filter applied differently
- **CRITICAL:** Using field existence checks instead of viewMode to choose which data to filter

## Testing Checklist

Before committing, test the following:

### 1. Daily View Search
- [ ] Search for "bst" in daily view
- [ ] Note the number of results
- [ ] Verify technicians displayed match the search
- [ ] Try searching by ID (e.g., "195")
- [ ] Try searching by requester name

### 2. Weekly View Search
- [ ] Switch to weekly view
- [ ] Search for "bst"
- [ ] Note the number of results (may be different from daily - this is OK)
- [ ] Search by ID and requester name
- [ ] Verify results match the week's data

### 3. Category Filtering
- [ ] Filter by category in daily view
- [ ] Filter by category in weekly view
- [ ] Combine search + category filter in both views
- [ ] Clear filters and verify all data shows

### 4. TechnicianDetail Page
- [ ] Click technician from daily view
- [ ] Verify search bar appears
- [ ] Search should work in all tabs (All Open, Self-Picked, Assigned, Closed)
- [ ] Click technician from weekly view
- [ ] Verify filters work in weekly context

### 5. Cross-Navigation
- [ ] Search in daily view (e.g., "bst")
- [ ] Click on a technician from filtered results
- [ ] Go back to dashboard
- [ ] Verify filters persist
- [ ] Switch to weekly view
- [ ] Search again
- [ ] Click technician
- [ ] Go back
- [ ] Verify filters still there

## Files Modified Summary

| File | Change | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `frontend/src/utils/ticketFilter.js` | NEW - Centralized utility | ✅ Done |
| `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` | Import & use centralized module | ✅ Done |
| `frontend/src/pages/TechnicianDetailNew.jsx` | Import & use centralized module | ✅ Done |
| `backend/src/routes/dashboard.routes.js` | Transform weeklyTickets (weekly view fix) | ✅ Done |
| `FILTERING_ARCHITECTURE.md` | Documentation | ✅ Done |

## Files Unchanged But Relevant

| File | Note |
|------|------|
| `frontend/src/components/SearchBox.jsx` | No changes needed - still works with new logic |
| `frontend/src/components/CategoryFilter.jsx` | No changes needed - still works with new logic |
| `frontend/src/pages/TechnicianDetail.jsx` | OLD file - not used, deprecate or remove |

## Critical Bug Fix: viewMode-Based Data Selection

### The Bug (What Was Wrong)
The old `getTechTickets()` function tried to guess which data to use:
```javascript
// ❌ BROKEN - uses field existence, not view mode
const getTechTickets = (tech) => {
  if (tech.weeklyTickets !== undefined) return tech.weeklyTickets;  // Always returns this!
  if (tech.tickets !== undefined) return tech.tickets;
  return [];
};
```

**Problem:** If both fields exist (even from different requests), it ALWAYS uses weeklyTickets, even in daily view!

This causes:
- Daily view searches to use weekly data
- Different results in daily vs weekly (showing different people)
- Filters applied to wrong dataset

### The Fix (What Changed)
The new function explicitly checks viewMode:
```javascript
// ✅ FIXED - uses current view mode to choose correctly
const getTechTickets = (tech) => {
  if (viewMode === 'weekly') {
    return tech.weeklyTickets || [];
  } else {
    return tech.tickets || [];
  }
};
```

**Result:** Always gets the right data for the current view, regardless of what fields exist in the object.

### Key Rule
**Always use `viewMode` to determine which field to access - NEVER rely on field existence checks when the data structure can vary between requests.**

## Next Steps After Testing

1. ✅ Test all scenarios above
2. ✅ Verify frontend hot-reload picks up changes
3. ✅ Restart backend to get transformation fix
4. 🔄 Commit changes with message:
   ```
   refactor: centralize ticket filtering logic for consistency

   - Extract filtering to frontend/src/utils/ticketFilter.js
   - Update Dashboard and TechnicianDetail to use centralized utilities
   - Fix backend weekly endpoint to transform tickets with requesterName
   - Add comprehensive filtering architecture documentation

   Fixes: Daily and weekly view search now use consistent logic
   ```

5. Delete old TechnicianDetail.jsx if confirmed not in use

## Troubleshooting

### If search doesn't work in weekly view
- Check that backend was restarted (transformation fix)
- Verify `weeklyTickets` array in network tab has `requesterName` field

### If daily and weekly show same results
- This might be OK if:
  - You're only searching for things created today
  - Category filter is too restrictive
- Check by searching for something from earlier in the week (won't appear in daily view)

### If filters don't persist
- Check sessionStorage is enabled in browser
- Check network tab to verify filter params are sent to backend
